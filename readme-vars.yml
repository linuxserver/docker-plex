  If you want to run the container in bridge network mode (instead of the recommended host network mode) you will need to specify ports.
  The [official documentation for ports](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201543147-what-network-ports-do-i-need-to-allow-through-my-firewall/) lists 32400 as the only required port.
  The rest of the ports are optionally used for specific purposes listed in the documentation.
  If you have not already claimed your server (first time setup) you need to set `PLEX_CLAIM` to claim a server set up with bridge networking.

  ```
    -p 32400:32400 \
    -p 1900:1900/udp \
    -p 3005:3005 \
    -p 5353:5353/udp \
    -p 8324:8324 \
    -p 32410:32410/udp \
    -p 32412:32412/udp \
    -p 32413:32413/udp \
    -p 32414:32414/udp \
    -p 32469:32469

  ```

  The application accepts a series of environment variables to further customize itself on boot:

  | Parameter | Function |
  | :---: | --- |
  | `--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri` | Add this option to your run command if you plan on using Quicksync hardware acceleration - see Application Setup section.|
  | `--device=/dev/dvb:/dev/dvb` | Add this option to your run command if you plan on using dvb devices.|

# application setup block
app_setup_block_enabled: true
app_setup_block: |
  Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:32400/web`

  ** Note about updates, if there is no value set for the VERSION variable, then no updates will take place.**

  ** For new users, no updates will take place on the first run of the container as there is no preferences file to read your token from, to update restart the Docker container after logging in through the webui**

  Valid settings for VERSION are:-

  `IMPORTANT NOTE:- YOU CANNOT UPDATE TO A PLEXPASS ONLY (BETA) VERSION IF YOU ARE NOT LOGGED IN WITH A PLEXPASS ACCOUNT`

  + **`docker`**: Let Docker handle the Plex Version, we keep our Dockerhub Endpoint up to date with the latest public builds. This is the same as leaving this setting out of your create command.
  + **`latest`**: will update plex to the latest version available that you are entitled to.
  + **`public`**: will update plexpass users to the latest public version, useful for plexpass users that don't want to be on the bleeding edge but still want the latest public updates.
  + **`<specific-version>`**: will select a specific version (eg 0.9.12.4.1192-9a47d21) of plex to install, note you cannot use this to access plexpass versions if you do not have plexpass.

  ## Hardware Acceleration
  
  ### Intel
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container:

  ```--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri```

  We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.

  ### Nvidia
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:

  https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
  
  We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the plex docker.
